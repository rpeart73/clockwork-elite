# Clockwork Elite v4.2.3

An intelligent task and case note generator with real-time analysis, context-aware note generation, and advanced email processing capabilities.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Smart Email Processing
- **Header-Only Date Extraction**: Intelligently extracts POCs only from email headers (Sent/Date lines), ignoring dates mentioned in content
- **Multi-Exchange Detection**: Consolidates multiple emails on the same day into single POC with exchange count
- **Last Date Prompt**: Automatically prompts for the last response date after email paste
- **Wait-for-Confirmation**: POCs only generate after last date is entered, preventing duplicates

### Context-Aware Note Generation

  - Topics/issues discussed
  - Questions asked by students
  - Actions taken or responses provided
  - Follow-up plans and next steps
  - Additional important details
- **No More Generic Notes**: Generates specific, accurate case notes based on actual conversation details

### Advanced Features
- **Smart POC Consolidation**: Same-day exchanges count as single POC
- **Manual Mode Toggle**: Switch between auto-detect, email, and task modes
- **Real-time Preview**: Shows POC count and allows adjustment before generation
- **Auto-save with Recovery**: Drafts save every 2 seconds with 1-hour recovery window
- **Task Distribution Patterns**: 
  - Equal distribution
  - Front-loaded
  - Back-loaded
  - Ascending (increasing hours)
  - Descending (decreasing hours)
