# Clockwork Elite Best Practices

## Overview
Clockwork Elite is an intelligent task and case note generator that adapts to your content. This guide covers effective patterns for using Clockwork Elite to maximize productivity and accuracy.

## 1. Content Input Best Practices

### Be Specific with Email Content
- **Copy the entire email thread** including headers if available
- **Include sender names** for automatic detection
- **Keep date references** like "yesterday" or "last Monday" for POC detection

### Effective Copy/Paste Workflow
```
1. Copy email from your email client
2. Paste directly into Clockwork Elite
3. Review detected POCs and student name
4. Adjust if needed before generating
```

### Multiple Sources Pattern
- Paste email first
- Add additional context below with separator
- System will analyze all content together

## 2. Optimize POC Detection

### Clear Date Indicators
Good examples that create separate POCs:
- "Following up on our meeting from Monday"
- "As we discussed yesterday"
- "Per our phone call on January 15th"

### Single vs Multiple POCs
The system intelligently determines POCs based on:
- Explicit date mentions
- Meeting/call references
- Follow-up indicators
- Temporal phrases

## 3. Task Generation Workflows

### Accurate Time Tracking
1. Select your date range
2. Note the business days calculated
3. Enter ONLY days actually worked
4. Tasks distribute evenly across those days

### Example Workflow
```
Date Range: Jan 1-31 (22 business days)
Days Worked: 8
Result: 8 task entries spread throughout January
```

## 4. Language and Detail Optimization

### Detail Depth Guidelines
- **Basic (3 points)**: Quick updates, simple tasks
- **Standard (5 points)**: Most common use case
- **Enhanced (7+ points)**: Complex projects, detailed documentation

### Language Selection
- **Canadian English**: organised, analysed, colour
- **British English**: organised, analysed, colour
- Both use same spelling conventions

## 5. Output Quality Tips

### Natural Narrative Style
- Best for professional case notes
- Adapts based on detected content
- No hallucination - only facts from input

### Bullet Point Style
- Quick documentation
- Consistent structure
- Generic enough for any context

## 6. Common Patterns

### Email Support Documentation
```
1. Paste student email
2. Verify auto-detected name
3. Generate with Natural Narrative
4. Review POCs (one per unique date)
5. Original email included at bottom
```

### Project Task Tracking
```
1. Paste project description
2. Set date range
3. Enter actual days worked
4. Generate evenly distributed tasks
5. Get summary with day count
```
